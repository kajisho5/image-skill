"""Decide the next release version from the labels of the PRs merged since the last tag.

Used by .github/workflows/release.yml (same approach as kajisho5/ffmpeg-skill). It
replaces calling release-drafter for version resolution, which on this repo either
resolved nothing (`disable-releaser: true` switches the resolver off) or ran live and
left a draft release behind (`dry-run` is not an input of release-drafter v6), and could
never answer "nothing to release" because its `default: patch` bumps regardless.

Rules (same label vocabulary as .github/release-drafter.yml's autolabeler):

  dependencies (Dependabot)          -> not releasable, whatever else it carries
  major / breaking                   -> refuse (exit 1): a major is a hand edit of package.json
  minor / feature / enhancement      -> minor
  patch / fix / bug                  -> patch
  only chore / ci / docs / test / refactor (or any other label) -> not releasable
  no label at all                    -> patch (a PR nobody labelled still ships)

A PR with `chore` AND `fix` is a fix. A commit on main that came from no PR is patch
unless its subject starts with chore/ci/docs/build/test/refactor. If nothing since the
last tag is releasable, the resolved version is empty and release.yml does nothing.

Pure logic lives in resolve(); main() wraps it with `git log` and `gh api`. Only label
names are read from the API, never PR text.
