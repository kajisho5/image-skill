# imagemagick-skill execution contract

`npx imagemagick-skill contract --json` (or `python3 scripts/_contract.py contract --json`)
prints a machine-readable description of this skill: every tool, its arguments, what its
`--json` output contains, and the rules every tool follows. This page is the same
contract for people. Its [Tools](#tools) section is generated from the JSON (see
`.github/scripts/contract_md.py`) and CI fails if the two differ, so it cannot drift from
the scripts.

## Versions

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `contract_version` | shape of this document (`1.0`) |
| `skill.version` | the npm / package.json version (`0.6.1`) |

`version` and `name` at the top level of the JSON repeat `skill.version` and `skill.id`;
they predate `skill` and stay for compatibility.

## Where the schemas come from

Each tool's `input_schema`, and the older `required_args` / `optional_args` lists, are
derived at run time from that script's own `build_parser()`: argument names, types,
choices, defaults, which are required, which are positional. Only what a parser cannot
state is written by hand in `TOOL_META` (`scripts/_contract.py`): the description, `role`,
`backends`, `verify`, and the `output_schema`. Adding a flag to a script therefore updates
the contract with no second edit; a script with no `TOOL_META` entry fails the tests.

## Invocation

Every tool is `python3 scripts/<tool>.py ARGS...`, run with an argv list, never through a
shell. Arguments map one-to-one from `input_schema`: a property whose `cli` is
`"positional"` is passed by position in `input_schema.positional` order; any other property
is passed with its flag (`cli` lists the spellings). Booleans are flags without a value.
`batch`'s `tool_args` go after a literal `--`.

## Result shapes

Every tool prints exactly one JSON object with `--json`.

| Case | Shape |
| --- | --- |
| success | `{"ok": true, ...}` with the keys in the tool's `output_schema` |
| failure | `{"ok": false, "reason": "..."}`, exit status 1 - including a malformed invocation (missing or invalid flags), which never falls back to argparse's usage text |
| `--dry-run` | `{"ok": true, "dry_run": true, "would_run": [argv...]}` - nothing is written |

A broken, empty or mislabeled output is a failure, never `ok: true`: tools that write a
file re-read it, and a file whose real format differs from its extension (ImageMagick can
exit 0 while writing the input's format when it has no encoder for the requested one) is
deleted and reported as `ok: false`.

## Guarantees

| Field (`execution`) | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shell` | `false` | no command is built as a shell string |
| `network` | `false` | no tool makes a network call |
| `input_mutation` | `false` | no tool writes to its input; `-o` must differ from it |
| `arbitrary_executables` | `false` | only the named script, `magick` and (macOS) `sips` run |

Every tool also reports `mutates_input: false`. An existing output is refused unless
`--overwrite` is given. `mogrify` is never used.

## Backends

`backends` lists what can run a tool: `magick` (ImageMagick 7's `magick`, or a
compatible command) and/or `sips` (macOS). `requires_magick: true` means there is no
`sips` path. `npx imagemagick-skill doctor --json` reports, per tool, whether this machine
can run it (`tools.<name>.usable`) and which backend it would use.

## MCP

`mcp/server.py` carries no tool table of its own. `tools/list` is
`[mcp_tool(t) for t in contract.tools]` (`scripts/_contract.py`): same names, same order,
the tool description, and an `inputSchema` translated from `input_schema` - each argparse
dest is a property (`json` excepted: the server always adds `--json`), positional ones
are named and marked "(positional N)", `batch`'s `tool_args` go after `--`, and mutually
exclusive groups are stated in the description. `tools/call` maps the arguments back to
argv with `mcp_argv()` and returns the script's JSON as `structuredContent` plus a text
copy; `ok: false` is `isError: true`, an unknown argument is a tool error (so the model
can correct it) and an unknown tool is a JSON-RPC error. No `outputSchema` is published:
MCP requires structured results to conform to it, and failures are a different shape.
`tests/test_mcp.py` checks that `contract --json`, this page and `tools/list` agree.

## Stability

Within 0.x, tool names, argument names and the keys listed in each `output_schema` are
kept; new optional arguments and new output keys may be added. Removing or renaming any of
them is a breaking change and ships only in a deliberate, hand-made version bump - release
automation refuses to choose a major version by itself.

## Example

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "name": "imagemagick-skill",
  "contract_version": "1.0",
  "skill": {"id": "imagemagick-skill", "version": "0.6.1", "execution_mode": "local"},
  "execution": {"shell": false, "network": false, "input_mutation": false, "arbitrary_executables": false},
  "tools": [{"name": "probe", "role": "analysis", "backends": ["magick", "sips"], "input_schema": {"...": "..."}}]
}
```
